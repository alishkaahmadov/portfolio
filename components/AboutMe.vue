            Hi there! I'm a full stack web developer with over 5 years of experience building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. From crafting clean and interactive frontends with Vue.js and Nuxt.js to architecting robust backends with Laravel and Node.js, I specialize in delivering complete web solutions that meet real-world needs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-[#1C1E53] text-base max-w-[800px] pb-4">
            I've had the opportunity to work on high-impact projects — from government platforms reviewed by state security agencies to real-time messaging systems and dynamic admin dashboards. My background spans frontend design, backend logic, API development, and database management across MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, all containerized with Docker for smooth deployment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-[#1C1E53] text-base max-w-[800px] pb-4">
            I’m passionate about creating digital products that are not just functional, but also fast, intuitive, and maintainable. Whether you need a custom dashboard, a dynamic website, or a real-time chat system, I’m here to help bring your vision to life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-[#1C1E53] text-base max-w-[800px] pb-4">
            Let’s build something great together — get in touch and let’s make it happen!
